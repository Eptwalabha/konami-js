# Konami code

## Why?
Well... for fun.  
I made it to practice javascript and TDD.

## How does it work?
It's simple... really:  

  1. Load the script <code>src/Konami.js</code> or <code>src/Konami.min.js</code> on your page.  
  2. Create a new konami and give it as parameter the function you want konami to trigger (and optionally the DOM element you want Konami to listen to).  
  3. Voil√†!  

Easy, isn't it?

## Well.. Heuu... Hummm...
Ok ok... I provided an example here <code>src/Konami.html</code>.

## Do I need any javascript library to make it work?
[Nope!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvdf5n-zI14)  
You need javascript enable though...

## May I use it? Copy it? Change it? Sell it? 
Sure, do whatever you want to do with it.  
I am not going to ask you anything but to give me feedback if something goes wrong with my code.
